### OpenCV
Contains opencv and Restnet stuff, using Yolo.
The other folder and code are from many years ago and perhaps not as relevant as it was back then.

Mainly from pyimagesearch. That guy is legit. Please check him out.
For the flowers code and dataset check here: https://github.com/RockyXu66/Kaggle_Flowers_Classification_Keras/blob/master/Flower_Classification_Keras.ipynb

### RAG
Good_RAG_Examples is new and shows multiple ways to build a RAG locally using ChromaDB, GPT4All, etc.

### RAG with LLM
RAG_with_local_llm is an end to end RAG using the data returned from our vector store, and passing that to LMStudio's local server using the Lambda3 model.
